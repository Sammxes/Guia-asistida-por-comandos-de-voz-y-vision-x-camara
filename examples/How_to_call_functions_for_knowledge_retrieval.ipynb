    "# How to use functions with a knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on the concepts in the [argument generation](How_to_call_functions_with_chat_models.ipynb) notebook, by creating an agent with access to a knowledge base and two functions that it can call based on the user requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an agent that uses data from arXiv to answer questions about academic subjects. It has two functions at its disposal:\n",
    "- **get_articles**: A function that gets arXiv articles on a subject and summarizes them for the user with links.\n",
    "- **read_article_and_summarize**: This function takes one of the previously searched articles, reads it in its entirety and summarizes the core argument, evidence and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will get you comfortable with a multi-function workflow that can choose from multiple services, and where some of the data from the first function is persisted to be used by the second.\n",

    "- **Search utilities:** Creating the two functions that access arXiv for answers.\n",
    "- **Configure Agent:** Building up the Agent behaviour that will assess the need for a function and, if one is required, call that function and present results back to the agent.\n",

      "- The critical temperature (Tc) approaches zero as the inter-chain coupling strength (C⊥) approaches zero, but there is a finite Tc for C⊥>0.\n",
      "- The spectral function shows peaks corresponding to particle motion across the double-well potential at higher temperatures and oscillations in a single well at lower temperatures.\n",

PPO uses a surrogate objective function that makes smaller updates to the policy parameters, resulting in more stable and efficient learning.\n",

       "- The study reveals regimes of memory/loss of memory and coherence/decoherence in the classical ϕ4 model subjected to periodic perturbations, which are essential in annealing phenomena.\n",
       "- The exploration of the analogy between lower-dimensional linear quantum systems and higher-dimensional classical nonlinear systems can lead to a deeper understanding of information processing in these systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "Evidence:\n",
       "- The authors analyze the dynamics and relaxation of weakly coupled ϕ4 chains through numerical simulations, studying the behavior of kink and breather excitations and the structural phase transition associated with the double well potential.\n",
       "- The critical temperature (Tc) approaches zero as the inter-chain coupling strength (C⊥) approaches zero, but there is a finite Tc for C⊥>0.\n",
       "- The spectral function shows peaks corresponding to particle motion across the double-well potential at higher temperatures and oscillations in a single well at lower temperatures.\n",
       "- The soft-mode frequency (ωs) decreases as temperature approaches Ts, the dynamical crossover temperature.\n",
       "- The relaxation process of the average displacement (QD) is controlled by spatially extended vibrations and large kink densities.\n",
       "- The mean domain size (⟨DS⟩) exhibits an algebraic decay for finite C⊥>0.\n",

       "- The study of weakly-coupled classical ϕ4 chains provides insights into quantum annealing architectures and the role of topological excitations in these systems.\n",
       "- The equilibration of the system is faster for higher kick strengths, and the mean domain size increases with higher final temperatures.\n",
       "- Further exploration of the crossover between decoherence and finite coherence in periodic-kick strength space is suggested.\n",
